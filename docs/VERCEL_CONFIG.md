# Vercel Environment Configuration

This document describes how we handle environment-specific URL routing for the Chassis documentation site.

## Problem

The Chassis documentation needs to route requests to different microservices depending on the environment:

- **Production**: `chassis-ui.com/docs/icons` â†’ `chassis-icons.vercel.app/docs/icons`
- **Staging**: `staging.chassis-ui.com/docs/icons` â†’ `chassis-icons-staging.vercel.app/docs/icons`

## Solution: Host Header Conditional Rewrites

We use Vercel's conditional rewrite functionality to detect the requesting domain and route to the appropriate services. This approach works seamlessly with git merge workflows without requiring manual intervention.

### How It Works

The `vercel.json` file contains conditional rewrites that:
1. Check the `host` header of incoming requests
2. Route staging domain requests (`staging.chassis-ui.com`) to staging services
3. Let production requests fall through to production services

### Configuration Structure

Each service has two rewrite rules in `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/docs/icons/:path*",
      "has": [
        {
          "type": "header",
          "key": "host", 
          "value": "staging.chassis-ui.com"
        }
      ],
      "destination": "https://chassis-icons-staging.vercel.app/docs/icons/:path*"
    },
    {
      "source": "/docs/icons/:path*",
      "destination": "https://chassis-icons.vercel.app/docs/icons/:path*"
    }
  ]
}
```

**How the rules work:**
1. **First rule**: If `host` header equals `staging.chassis-ui.com`, route to staging service
2. **Second rule**: Fallback rule for all other domains (production)

## URL Mapping

| Path | Staging Domain | Production Domain |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| `/docs/assets/:path*` | `chassis-assets-staging.vercel.app` | `chassis-assets.vercel.app` |
| `/docs/css/:path*` | `chassis-css-staging.vercel.app` | `chassis-css.vercel.app` |
| `/docs/tokens/:path*` | `chassis-tokens-staging.vercel.app` | `chassis-tokens.vercel.app` |
| `/docs/figma/:path*` | `chassis-figma-staging.vercel.app` | `chassis-figma.vercel.app` |
| `/docs/icons/:path*` | `chassis-icons-staging.vercel.app/docs/icons/` | `chassis-icons.vercel.app/docs/icons/` |
| `/assets/icons/:path*` | `chassis-icons-staging.vercel.app/assets/` | `chassis-icons.vercel.app/assets/` |

## Development Workflow

### Working with Staging
1. Work on the `staging` branch
2. Push changes â†’ Deploys to `staging.chassis-ui.com`
3. URLs automatically route to `-staging` services due to domain detection

### Production Release
1. Merge `staging` branch to `main` 
2. Push to `main` â†’ Deploys to `chassis-ui.com`
3. URLs automatically route to production services due to domain detection
4. **No manual configuration changes needed!** ðŸŽ‰

## Benefits

âœ… **Single Configuration**: One `vercel.json` works for both environments  
âœ… **Merge-Safe**: No manual editing required during stagingâ†’main merges  
âœ… **Domain-Based**: Routing happens automatically based on the requesting domain  
âœ… **Maintainable**: Changes apply to both environments simultaneously  

## Technical Details

### Vercel Configuration
- Uses `"type": "header", "key": "host"` to detect the requesting domain
- Follows Vercel's documented conditional rewrite patterns
- Works in production deployments (not in `vercel dev` locally)

### Limitations
- **Local Development**: Conditional rewrites don't work with `vercel dev` 
- **Testing**: Must test on actual staging/production URLs, not localhost

## Verification Commands

Test staging environment:
```bash
curl -I https://staging.chassis-ui.com/docs/icons/
# Should show 401/404 from chassis-icons-staging.vercel.app
```

Test production environment:
```bash
curl -I https://chassis-ui.com/docs/icons/
# Should show 401/404 from chassis-icons.vercel.app  
```

## Configuration Files Reference

- **`vercel.json`** - Main configuration with conditional rewrites
- **`vercel.staging.json`** - Template/backup for staging-specific config
- **`vercel.production.json`** - Template/backup for production-specific config

## Development Workflow

### For Staging Changes
1. Work on the `staging` branch
2. Push changes â†’ Automatically deploys with staging URLs
3. Test on `staging.chassis-ui.com`

### For Production Release
1. Merge `staging` branch to `main` 
2. **Important**: Update `vercel.json` on `main` branch to use production URLs
3. Push to `main` â†’ Automatically deploys with production URLs
4. Test on `chassis-ui.com`

## Configuration Files

- `vercel.json` - The active configuration (different per branch)
- `vercel.staging.json` - Template for staging configuration  
- `vercel.production.json` - Template for production configuration
- `build/generate-vercel-urls.cjs` - Helper script (not used in current solution)

## Branch Switching Command

When switching from staging to production (or vice versa), you can use:

```bash
# Switch to staging URLs
cp vercel.staging.json vercel.json

# Switch to production URLs  
cp vercel.production.json vercel.json
```

## Verification

To verify the configuration is working:

```bash
# Test staging routing (should return 401 - means routing works)
curl -I "https://staging.chassis-ui.com/docs/icons"

# Test production routing (should return 401 - means routing works)  
curl -I "https://chassis-ui.com/docs/icons"

# Test direct staging service access
curl -I "https://chassis-icons-staging.vercel.app/docs/icons"

# Test direct production service access
curl -I "https://chassis-icons.vercel.app/docs/icons"
```

## Troubleshooting

If the wrong URLs are being used:

1. **Check Current Branch**: Ensure you're on the correct branch (`staging` vs `main`)
2. **Verify vercel.json**: Check that `vercel.json` contains the expected URLs for your branch
3. **Compare with Templates**: Ensure `vercel.json` matches `vercel.staging.json` or `vercel.production.json`
4. **Test Direct URLs**: Verify the target services are accessible
5. **Check Deployment**: Ensure the latest commit is deployed on Vercel

## Migration Notes

This solution replaced a previous approach that attempted to generate `vercel.json` during build time. The current branch-based approach is more reliable because:

- âœ… Vercel reads `vercel.json` directly from git (no build-time dependencies)
- âœ… Simple and predictable behavior per branch
- âœ… No environment variable detection issues
- âœ… Works consistently across all deployment types
